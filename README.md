Rubin Future is a community planning hub for what Rubin Observatory can become after the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

> [!NOTE]
> This site is under construction as the Rubin Future effort takes shape.

## Editing Content

Most updates should not require layout or CSS changes.

### Add a Meeting

Edit `_data/meetings.yml` and add a new entry:

```yaml
- title: Meeting title
  date: 2026-09-15
  status: upcoming
  location: Online
  host: Organizing group
  url: "https://example.org"
  materials:
    - title: Agenda
      url: "https://example.org/agenda"
```

Use `status: upcoming` for future meetings and `status: past` for previous meetings. `materials` is optional.

### Add a Document

Edit `_data/documents.yml` and add a new entry:

```yaml
- title: Document title
  url: "https://example.org"
  description: Short description.
  year: 2026
  type: Report
```

`description`, `year`, and `type` are optional.

To group related documents into one card, add `materials`:

```yaml
- title: Document group title
  description: Short description.
  year: 2026
  type: White Papers
  materials:
    - title: First paper
      url: "https://example.org/first"
    - title: Second paper
      url: "https://example.org/second"
```

To link to an editable page that lives on this website, create a Markdown file and use a root-relative site URL:

```yaml
- title: Example editable materials page
  url: "/pages/example-editable-page/"
  description: This entry links to a Markdown page in this repo.
  year: 2026
  type: Website page
```

Use root-relative paths for pages in this site; Jekyll adds the configured `/rubin-future` base path when building for GitHub Pages.

### Edit Pages

The main prose pages are Markdown files in the repository root:

- `index.md`
- `meetings.md`
- `documents.md`
- `community.md`

## Local Preview

Use Ruby 3.3 or newer for the closest match to GitHub Pages.

Install dependencies:

```sh
bundle install
```

Preview the site:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""
```

This serves the site from `/` for local preview.

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

Build without serving:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Publishing

On GitHub, enable Pages for this repository:

1. Open repository settings.
2. Go to Pages.
3. Select "Deploy from a branch".
4. Select branch `main` and folder `/root`.
5. Save.

GitHub Pages will publish updates after commits are pushed to `main`.
